Kubean uses Kubespray as the underlying technology. On the one hand, it simplifies the operation process of cluster deployment and lowers the threshold of use. On the other hand, many new features such as cluster operation records and offline version records have been added on the basis of Kubespray's capabilities.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Kubean runs several controllers to track changes of Kubean CRDs and communicates with the underlying cluster's API server to create Kubernetes native resources.
