It controls and manages cluster lifecycle (install, uninstall, upgrade, scale up &amp; down, etc.) by applying the standard CRDs provided by Kubean and Kubernetes built-in resources. Kubean uses Kubespray as the underlying technology. On the one hand, it simplifies the operation process of cluster deployment and lowers the threshold of use. On the other hand, many new features such as cluster operation records and offline version records have been added on the basis of Kubespray's capabilities.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Kubean runs several controllers to track changes of Kubean CRDs and communicates with the underlying cluster's API server to create Kubernetes native resources. It consists of four components\uff1a</p> <ol> <li>Cluster Controller: monitors 'Cluster Objects'.

It can run on bare metal machines, virtual machines, and most kinds of cloud environment. It supports a wide range of Kubernetes versions and various plugins. With Kubespray, you can flexibly build and configure clusters from 0 to 1, and maintain you clusters through their lifecycles.</p> <p>Kubean is based on Kubespray and boasts all the advantages of Kubespray. Moreover, Kubean introduces the concept of Operator to fully implement the philosophy of cloud native. Kubean is designed to run as a container, and can be easily installed with a Helm chart.</p> <p>Kubespray only supports offline at the parameter level and provides no process for building an offline install package, making it very troublesome for users who need to use it offline. They may gradually lose patience with Kubespray.</p> <p>Kubean not only has a mature workflow for making offline packages, it also simplifies Kubespray's configuration, allowing users to manage cluster life cycle in a cloud-native way.</p>"},{"location":"concepts/crds/","title":"CRDs","text":"<p>CustomResourceDefinition (CRD) is a Kubernetes built-in resource for creating custom resources to further extend the Kubernetes API.
